# License
Some things will follow either the BSD or DWTFYW (Do what the fuck you want) license.
Other things will be LGPLv3 so that you're free to use it in your own projects AS IS without having to disclose your own source.
Yet others will be GPL, because fuck you and your proprietary nonsense.
I'm not uniformly religious about these things. Different licenses for different reasons :)
The applicable will either be embedded into the script code or be in the COPYING file in the directory.
